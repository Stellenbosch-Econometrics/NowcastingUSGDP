## Research question(s)

There are two parts to our research question. One part relates to performance, the other to ease of use. 

<br>

> Do machine learning (and deep learning) methods contribute to forecasting performance over and above the traditional forecasting models? How easy are these methods to implement?


## Managing expectations

<br>

This is **not** a technical talk on the methods used. 

The talk is more about our results and the way that our experience translates to practitioners.

# Data

## Data

<br> 
 

The **target variable** is the seasonally adjusted annualised quarter-on-quarter growth rate of GDP covering the period from 1993-06-31 to 2022-03-31. 

<br> 

::: columns
Quarterly and monthly macroeconomic variables are collected using data from the FRED-QD and FRED-MD. 
:::



::: aside

Target variable is often used in machine learning, while dependent variable is more common in econometrics. 
:::

## Data preparation and cleaning

<br>

Remove variables with large proportion of missing data.

  - Percentage of entire series
  - Percentage of most recent observations

Outliers removed (beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range)

Remove variables that are scalar multiples.

## Data transformations

<br> 

ADF test used to determine whether a unit root (or roots) is (are) present for each variable.

- I(0) variables: level
- I(1) variables: **growth rate**
- I(2) variables: **rate of growth**


All variables are standardized following transformation.

::: aside
Ignore compounding effects when annualizing growth rate and rate of growth.
:::

## Data transformations (cont.)

## Suggestions

Space for improvement possible here. Suggestions are welcome. 

:::

<br>

Create new variables from the values of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month of each quarter.

**Alternative**: Monthly variables aggregated to a quarterly level using the mean of the monthly values (after which transformations and standardizations are applied)
