This directory contains .csv and .pdf versions of the FRED-QD appendix. 

Files labeled "updated" give the most recent version of the appendix, containing only the most up to date series that are currently inclued in FRED-QD. To minimize confusion between vintages, we did not reorder id's when series were removed without a replacement. Because of this, there are some skips in id numbers (e.g., there is no series with an id of 162).

Files labeled "historic" give every series that has been in a vintage so far. However, for series that were replaced with an alternative we report the name of the new series that uses the same id. See the "Changes to FRED-QD" file to identify those series which have been replaced with a substitute.
